On August 31, we submitted 4 runs to the KBP Cold Start Slot Filling competition, whose results will probably be shared in a couple of 
months.  Our 4 runs are 3 single system runs of Openie, Implie, and Multir (PER-LOC relations only, based on supervised training), and a 
run which combines output from those 3 systems.

The Cold Start Slot Filling variant involves filling PER, ORG, and GPE slots for ~10k queries based on a corpus of ~50k 
never-before-seen documents, 80% of which are news forum docs and 20% newswire.  There are 2 rounds of slot-filling for about half of 
the queries.  Together the two rounds represent a pseudo-slot; for example, round1 asks for residents of San Diego and round2 asks for 
organizations founded by those residents of San Diego.

The combined system produced 24328 slot fills for round 1, and 8224 for round 2.

For the single systems, all 3 systems started with the original set of ~10k queries,
and the second round queries are based on the results only from the slot fills from each individual system (not from all 3, as is the 
case for the combined system).

Openie produced 2569 slot fills for round 1, and 477 for round 2.
Implie produced 17337 slot fills for round 1, and 1962 for round 2.
Multir produced 7459 slot fills for round 1, and 904 for round 2.
